# Watch me roam

## Description
Watch me roam is a travel log allowing users to display their itinerary on a map by registering each stop they make with location, date, description and pictures. They can share the link to non-users so they can follow along during the trip.

## MVP 
- authorization/authentification
- home page with all trips listed
- 'add new trip' page
- 'edit trip' page
- 'trip overview' page with all stops of one trip listed
- 'map overview' page with all the stops displayed and linked on the map
- 'view stop details' page
- 'add new stop' page
- 'edit stop' page
- start date of a stop can not be before start date of the trip

## User Stories
-  **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault
-  **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start creating and managing my backlog
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can start creating and managing my backlog
-  **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can modify my information
-  **Add elements** As a user I can add elements to my backlog
-  **Delete elements** As a user I can delete elements from my backlog
-  **Edit elements** As a user I can edit elements from my backlog
-  **Check overview and map of a trip** As a user I can check my stops overview and map



## Backlog

- statistics page (how many countries visited, how many km, flags, continent)
- add a key to the stopModel 'people' and link it to a new model 'people' where information about peoplethe user is travelling with
- add automatic weather display for each step
- trip overview and map over view on the same page (flex box?)
- add a new stop by starting on clicking on a country on a map
- add 'comment' and 'like' buttons on each stop for followers
